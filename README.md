# Leap
Leap and explore the map for shiny stars and rare gold while avoiding bombs to achieve glory!

**About**

The object of the game is simple. 
You leap off of trampolines to collect gold and stars, 
which give you bonuses. 
However, you need to be careful because there are bombs
waiting to explode and dangerous deaths if you fall down.
The score works in the following way:
Collecting a star = +100
Collecting gold = +350-1000
Hitting certain objects will send you back to the start.
These objects include the death layer and bombs.
NOTE: Although these things send you back to the start, they do not revert your score back to zero.
You will retain your score and get to continue exploring the same map looking for gold and stars.
Hitting a trampoline will not increase your score, but it allows you to continue going up to explore the map. 
You can land on trampolines that are outside of the view, which is especially important for trampolines below the screen position.
